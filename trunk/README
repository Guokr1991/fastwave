=========================

This is the first version of this program, you just need to change the main function to read
velocity or density parameters from files, it can calculate acoustic wavefield in complex media. 

Also, you can set staggered-grid difference coefficients with different lengths, the adaptive 
coefficient setting will be added in the comming days.

PML is used to handle absorbing boundary to simulate the infinite media that outgoing wave will
disperse on the boundary domain without artefact reflection. 

NOTICE: There is no gurantee for this program to be suited to your problem, although it can model
almost all kinds of wave phenomena in complex acoustic media. You who downloaded this software 
should adventure your own risk.

Any bug report or modification will be welcome. Please contact
